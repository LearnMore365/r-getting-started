# Working with R in RStudio

RStudio is an integraged development evironment (IDE). This means it offers a 
lot of tools to make working with the R programming language easier. We will 
explain the most important tools while also introducing you to the basics of 
the R programming lanugage. 


```{r rstudio-view, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='RStudio (This is the caption)', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/images/RStudio.png", dpi = img_dpi)
```

When you open up RStudio you see a couple of windows and each window has a couple of tabs. We are not going to go into all the tabs here, but we will explain and explore the most important ones. The most important tabs to get familiar with are:

1. Console, where you can interactively run code
2. Source, where you can edit files
3. Environment, where you can check on the state of your analysis
4. History, where you can check what code you've ran
5. Files, where you manage your folders and files during analysis
6. Help, where you can read documentation
7. Viewer, where you can view plots or other graphical or interactive elements of your analysis

## Arithmetic Operators

Now that you are all set up we want to dive straight into using R. The console is where you can interactively run commands. You can think of R as a calculator - a very powerful calculator. R supports the five basic arithmetic operations.

```{r, results='hold'}
4 + 5    # Addition
10 - 1   # Subtraction
3 * 3    # Multiplication
27 / 3   # Division
3 ** 2   # Power

# Standard operator presedence and parentheses rules apply
(35 + 8) * 2 ** (10 / 2) - 39
```

There are two ways of writing the power operator `**` and `^`. Personally, I prefer the first way.

## First Script

Most of the time you'll want to document the commands you run. You can create a new file by clicking  File -> New File -> R Script File  or by pressing Cmd + Shift + N.

Create a new file and add the following line.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print("Hello from R!")
```


Here, we are using a function `print`. You may suspect that the `print` function prints something and you would be correct. We will look at other functions soon.
Now, save the file by either clicking the floppy drive symbol (or pressing Cmd + S). Give then file the name `hello.R`

Clicking the _Source_ button (or pressing Cmd + Shift + S) on the top right border will make R exectute the code in the file and your console will show something along these lines.

    > source('~/r-course/hello.R', echo=TRUE)
    
    > print("Hello from R!")
    [1] "Hello from R!"

We've sourced the file `hello.R` and the console shows that it ran the command `print("Hello from R!")` and the output was `[1] "Hello from R!"`.

Add the artirhmetic expression to the file.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
print("Hello from R!")

53 - 11
```

Bring your cursor to the end of the first line after `print("Hello from R!")` and press Cmd + Enter, this will run (source) just this one line. The cursor will automaticall jump to the end of the line after the next command. If you press Cmd + Enter again it will run next line. 


```{r, eval=TRUE}
print("Hello from R!")

53 - 11
```

## Variables 

Variables are a fundamental building block of R and any programming language. They allow you to reference values.

Usually you will have to store results from running a command and sometimes you want t

```{r}
my_first_variable <- 42
my_text <- "This is some text!"
```

When you enter this on your R console in RStudio nothing will happen. We have told R to store the number 42 in a variable and we call this specific variable `my_first_variable`. To retrieve the value of our variable we just type the variable name and hit enter.

```{r}
my_first_variable
my_text
```

Arithmetic operations work on variables just like they do on literal numbers.

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 10
x * y
```

Of course we can assign the value to another variable and later use that variable in another computation.

```{r}
z <- x * y + 3
w <- z - x
```


You can check on your variables in the Environment tab.

-- Screenshot

Keep these things in mind when creating variables:

Choose short and descriptive variable names and always use underscores to separate words. Variable names can contain numbers but they can't start with a number. Always use the 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Error
1_x <- 9
# Bad
BadName <- 9
# Good
good_name <- 9
good_name_2 <- 2
# Bad Assignment Operator
bad_assign = 9
```

## Vectors 


Vectors are a data-structure. They can hold multiple values at once and they can be referenced by a single variable. To create a vector you will use `c()`.

```{r}
my_first_vector <- c(42, 5, 10)
```

You can have a glimpse at the values in your vector by typing its name.

```{r}
my_first_vector
```

Performing arithmetics on vector is analogous to atomic values. 

```{r}
my_first_vector * 10
```

Shorthand for vectors

```{r, results='hold'}
1:10
1:5 * 2
```

## Logic 


Comparison

```{r, results='hold'}
1:3 > 2  # Greater
1:3 >= 2 # Greater Equal
1:3 == 2 # Equals
1:3 <= 2 # Less Equal 
1:3 < 2  # Less
```

Combination

```{r, results='hold'}
TRUE & FALSE
TRUE | FALSE
```



## Functions 


Whenever you tell R to run some command, R will execute that command in an environment.


derp


```{r}
sum(my_first_vector)
sd(my_first_vector)
var(my_first_variable)
```


### Help `?` 

There is a built in help in R. You can use it by putting an `?` in front of a function name.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?sum
```

## The Console (bl)

> [Action] Show arthimetic ops here

Now that you are all set up we want to dive straight into using R. To get the
most out of this tutorial you should try to run the code yourself on the
console in RStudio. You can think of R as a calculator - a very powerful
calculator. R supports the five basic arithmetic operations you are familiar
with and three more you might not yet have seen. The operators for addition,
subtraction and multiplication are self explanatory.

```{r, results='hold'}
4 + 5    # Addition
10 - 1   # Subtraction
3 * 3    # Multiplication
27 / 3   # Division
3 ** 2   # Power

# Standard operator presedence and parentheses rules apply
(35 + 8) * 2 ** (10 / 2) - 39
```

There are two ways of writing the power operator `**` and `^`. Personally,
I prefer the first way.

Now, let's have a look at the three less common operator. They are modulo,
whole number division and matrix-multiplication. test change

```{r, results='hold'}
43 %% 7               # Modulo
43 %/% 7              # Whole number division
c(4, 2) %*% c(2, 4)   # Matrix-multiplication
```

ow, let's define our first variable. We will call it `my_first_variable`.


### Creating variables


```{r}
my_first_variable <- 42
```

When you enter this on your R console in RStudio nothing will happen. We have told R to store the number 42 in a variable and we call this specific variable `my_first_variable`. To retrieve the value of our variable we just type the variable name and hit enter.

```{r}
my_first_variable
```

Arithmetic operations work on variables just like they do on literal numbers.

```{r}
a <- 5
b <- 10
a * b
```

### Vectors


Vectors are a data-structure. They can hold multiple values at once and they can be referenced by a single variable. To create a vector you will use `c()`.

```{r}
my_first_vector <- c(42, 5, 10)
```

You can have a glimpse at the values in your vector by typing its name.

```{r}
my_first_vector
```

Performing arithmetics on vector is analogous to atomic values. 

```{r}
my_first_vector * 10
```

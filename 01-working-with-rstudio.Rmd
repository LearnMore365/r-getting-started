# Working with R in RStudio

RStudio is an integraged development evironment (IDE). This means it offers a 
lot of tools to make working with the R programming language easier. We will 
explain the most important tools while also introducing you to the basics of 
the R programming lanugage. 

When you open up RStudio you see a couple of windows and each window has a couple of tabs. We are not going to go into all the tabs here, but we will explain and explore the most important ones. The most important tabs to get familiar with are:

1. Console, where you can interactively run code
2. Source, where you can edit files
3. Environment, where you can check on the state of your analysis
4. History, where you can check what code you've ran
5. Files, where you manage your folders and files during analysis
6. Help, where you can read documentation
7. Viewer, where you can view plots or other graphical or interactive elements of your analysis

## The Console (bl)


Now that you are all set up we want to dive straight into using R. To get the
most out of this tutorial you should try to run the code yourself on the
console in RStudio. You can think of R as a calculator - a very powerful
calculator. R supports the five basic arithmetic operations you are familiar
with and three more you might not yet have seen. The operators for addition,
subtraction and multiplication are self explanatory.

```{r, results='hold'}
4 + 5    # Addition
10 - 1   # Subtraction
3 * 3    # Multiplication
27 / 3   # Division
3 ** 2   # Power

# Standard operator presedence and parentheses rules apply
(35 + 8) * 2 ** (10 / 2) - 39
```

There are two ways of writing the power operator `**` and `^`. Personally,
I prefer the first way.

Now, let's have a look at the three less common operator. They are modulo,
whole number division and matrix-multiplication.

```{r, results='hold'}
43 %% 7               # Modulo
43 %/% 7              # Whole number division
c(4, 2) %*% c(2, 4)   # Matrix-multiplication
```

### Creating variables {-}


```{r}
my_first_variable <- 42
```

When you enter this on your R console in RStudio nothing will happen. We have told R to store the number 42 in a variable and we call this specific variable `my_first_variable`. To retrieve the value of our variable we just type the variable name and hit enter.

```{r}
my_first_variable
```

Arithmetic operations work on variables just like they do on literal numbers.

```{r}
a <- 5
b <- 10
a * b
```

### Vectors {-}


Vectors are a data-structure. They can hold multiple values at once and they can be referenced by a single variable. To create a vector you will use `c()`.

```{r}
my_first_vector <- c(42, 5, 10)
```

You can have a glimpse at the values in your vector by typing its name.

```{r}
my_first_vector
```

Performing arithmetics on vector is analogous to atomic values. 

```{r}
my_first_vector * 10
```


## Environment (tr)

Whenever you tell R to run some command, R will execute that command in an environment.


Shorthand for vectors

```{r, results='hold'}
1:10
1:5 * 2
```

# Setup

R is free software. 

We are going to walk you through the process _step-by-step_.

## Installing R and RStudio

You can install R by going to the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) website.

```{r setup-install-r-cran, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='The CRAN homepage', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/images/setup-install-r-cran.png", dpi = img_dpi)
```

Click the link for your operating system.

and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

### RStudio

R itself does not come with a nice graphical interface. More text

In this section you will be guided through the installation process and then be ready to start your project.

## Creating A New Project

You should always create a project when you work on an analysis with RStudio. It helps you organize your analysis and takes care of low-level stuff. 

In the top left, click on _File_ and then select _New Project..._ and you should have a window pop up.

```{r rstudio-new-project, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='This is the new Project Window', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/images/rstudio-new-project.png", dpi = img_dpi)
```

Now, select _New Directory_ and then _New Project_.


```{r rstudio-new-project-type, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Choose the type of project.', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/images/rstudio-new-project-type.png", dpi = img_dpi)
```


Give your project a name (`r-course`) and tell it where to save the project. Your R-project will not be a single file but a folder.

```{r rstudio-new-project-dir, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Name and Location', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/images/rstudio-new-project-dir.png", dpi = img_dpi)
```


That's it you have created your first RStudio R-project.

```{r rstudio-new-project-done, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Hurray!', out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("static/images/rstudio-new-project-done.png", dpi = img_dpi)
```


You can load projects via _Recent Projects_ under _File_.
